# Loan_Prediction
loan prediction model can help banks and other financial institutions to accurately predict the likelihood of a loan applicant defaulting on their payments. 
By using historical data on loan applications and repayment patterns, the model can identify patterns and trends thatcan help banks make better lending decisions.
A loan Prediction Project which includes some models trained using different classification algorithms.
The dataset consists of 13 different columns and a total of 614 rows including various information about the customers salary and loan capability.
Predictor Variables : Loan_Id,Gender,Married,Dependents,Education,Self_Employed,Credit_History,Property_Area,TotalIncome,LoanAmount,Loan_Amount_Term
Target Variables : Loan_Status
The data given in the dataset includes some missing values and is not scaled to same paramaters.Hence , some data preproccessing and plots for data Visualisation are done
The project includes log transformation , standardzing (scaling ) of data , transformation of categorical data to integer data.
Models trained in these project includes 4 different classification reports : 
Random Forest Classifier
Decision Tree
Gaussian Naive Bayes
KNeighbors Classifier.
Some metrics are used to evalute the model with best accuracy.
One can find out the solution to the loan prediction problem using this model.
